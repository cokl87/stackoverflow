## Installation
For the analysis python3.8 was used ogether with a jupyther notebook. In order to get the project running you'll need also some 3rd party libraries which are all mentioned in the requirements.txt file, included in this project which can be used for generating a virtualenv.


## Project Motivation
I used the Stack Overflow survey data of 2019 to find insights in what makes people satisfied with their job. The questions I tried to answer:

1. What are the most important factors for beeing satisfied with your job based on the survey data?
2. What are people looking for when they look for a new job -is there a difference in what satisfied people look for?
3. Is there a connection between job satisfaction and the loyalty of employees to their job?


## File Descriptions
There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
* [screening_of_data.ipynb](./screening_of_data.ipynb): This notebook was used to get a overview of the available survey-data and checking if the survey data between years has a similar form. 'What quuestions can be answered?', 'What data can be used?'
* [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb): This notebook was used for actually answering the questions abouve

There are some adition .py files which classes and functions used in the notebooks:
* [functions.py](./functions.py) some generalized functions used in the analysis
* [log_config.py](./log_config.py) basic configuration of a logger used
* [plotter.py](./plotter.py) plotter class used for generating plots for the report


## Results
Are shortly discussed in markdown cells within the notebooks. The main findings are discussed in this [post]().
